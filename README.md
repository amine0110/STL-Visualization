# STL-Visualization
If you are looking for 3D STL visualization using Python then this code is for you. You can visualize any 3D mesh in the STL format using Python and also you can interact with the 3D viewer (zooming in/out, moving the mesh).

## Can we do it for NIFTI?
You can do the same thing for the `NIFTI` files, but you need to adapt your code a little bit, I did something similar and the code is available in my Premium Repository. If you are interested, you can access it [here](https://www.premium.pycad.co/l/organization).
